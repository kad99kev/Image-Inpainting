# Image-Inpainting
Image Inpainting using PyTorch.

This repository is a PyTorch implementation of the [Deep Image Inpainting](https://www.wandb.com/articles/introduction-to-image-inpainting-with-deep-learning) article by [Ayush Thakur](https://github.com/ayulockin) and [Sayak Paul](https://github.com/sayakpaul). Link to the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ayulockin/deepimageinpainting).

Weights and Biases was used to log the loss, metrics and outputs. Link to my runs can be found [here](https://wandb.ai/kad99kev/inpainting).
